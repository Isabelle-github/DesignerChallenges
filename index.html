            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design
                skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense
                with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
                really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.

                    As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
